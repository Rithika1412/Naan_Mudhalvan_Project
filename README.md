## 1. Facial Recognition System for Security

**Description:**  
A facial recognition system designed to identify or verify individuals using facial features from images or video streams. It is commonly used for secure access control, surveillance, and identity verification.

**Input:**
- Image or video stream from webcam or security cameras
- Format: Typically RGB

**Output:**
- Face detection with bounding boxes around detected faces in each frame

## 2. Healthcare Imaging Analysis

**Description:**  
AI-based medical image analysis system used for detecting and localizing abnormalities in healthcare imaging. Assists with diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring.

**Input:**
- Medical images from modalities such as X-ray, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, PET
- Formats: DICOM, JPEG, PNG, TIFF

**Output:**
- Detection and localization of abnormalities using bounding boxes or segmentation masks
- Highlights features such as tumors, lesions, and fractures

## 3. Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System

**Description:**  
ALPR system detects and reads vehicle license plates from video or image frames. Used for applications such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, and law enforcement.

**Input:**
- Image or video frames from roadside/toll booth/parking lot cameras
- Format: RGB or infrared (for night vision)

**Output:**
- License plate detection with bounding boxes around plates
- Extracted license plate text for further processing
